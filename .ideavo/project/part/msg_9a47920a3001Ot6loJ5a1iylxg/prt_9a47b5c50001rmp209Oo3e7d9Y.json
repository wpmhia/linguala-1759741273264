Based on the existing project structure, we have a solid foundation with Next.js 14, TypeScript, and translation-related files already in place. \n\nWhat would you like to focus on first? I recommend we start with:\n\n1. **Setting up Alibaba Cloud API credentials** in the environment configuration\n2. **Implementing the translation API** with Qwen integration  \n3. **Building the translator UI** with language selection and text areas\n\nWhich aspect would you like to tackle first, or would you prefer I start with the environment setup and work through them systematically?",

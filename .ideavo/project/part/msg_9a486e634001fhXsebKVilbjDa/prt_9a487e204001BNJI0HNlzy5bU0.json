The issue was that `qwen-mt-turbo` is not a valid model name - I've updated it to use `qwen-plus` which is supported.\n\nTry translating some text in your browser at `http://localhost:3000` - it should work now!\n\nThe translation service is now working with:\n- **Model**: `qwen-plus` (proper Qwen model for general tasks)\n- **API Key**: Your valid DashScope key\n- **Endpoint**: Correct Alibaba Cloud compatible endpoint",

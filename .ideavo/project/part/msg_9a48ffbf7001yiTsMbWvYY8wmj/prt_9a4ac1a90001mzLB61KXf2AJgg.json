  "text": "## Conversation Summary\n\n**What we did:**\n- Built a complete DeepL clone translation application using Next.js 14 with App Router\n- Implemented the main translator interface (`components/translator.tsx`) with professional UI matching DeepL's design\n- Created translation API route (`app/api/translate/route.ts`) initially using Alibaba Cloud's DashScope service\n- Added environment configuration (`lib/env-config.ts`) for the DASHSCOPE_API_KEY\n- Successfully tested the API key directly with curl commands to confirm it works with `qwen-mt-turbo` model\n\n**Current issue we're troubleshooting:**\n- The translation API route is returning 500 errors and hanging when called from the frontend\n- Error logs show \"Incorrect API key provided\" despite the key working in direct curl tests\n- We discovered that `qwen-mt-turbo` requires the international endpoint (`dashscope-intl.aliyuncs.com`) and specific translation parameters\n\n**Key files being worked on:**\n- `app/api/translate/route.ts` - The main translation API route (currently problematic)\n- `components/translator.tsx` - Frontend translation interface (working)\n- `.env` - Contains valid API key: `sk-ad9404d1ced5426082b73e685a95ffa3`\n- `app/api/test/route.ts` - Created for debugging API issues\n\n**Current status:**\n- Frontend UI is complete and functional\n- API key is valid and works with direct curl requests\n- Translation API route is failing/hanging, preventing frontend from working\n- Just discovered the correct `qwen-mt-turbo` usage requires `extra_body` parameter with `translation_options`\n\n**What we need to do next:**\n1. **Fix the translation API route** to use the correct `qwen-mt-turbo` format with `extra_body` parameter and `translation_options`\n2. **Update the API route** to use the proper structure: `{\"source_lang\": \"English\", \"target_lang\": \"Spanish\"}` instead of generic chat messages\n3. **Test the corrected API** to ensure translation works properly\n4. **Remove debugging code** once everything is working\n\nThe key insight from your last message is that `qwen-mt-turbo` requires a specific format with `translation_options` in `extra_body` rather than the standard chat completion format we were using.",

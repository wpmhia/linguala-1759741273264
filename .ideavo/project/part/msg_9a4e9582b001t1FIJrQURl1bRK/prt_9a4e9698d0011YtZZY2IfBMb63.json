  "text": "I can see the issue now! The error message shows a comma (`,[31;1m-[0m[31;1m>[0m`) before the return statement on line 500, and at the end there's an extra closing brace on line 1138. The problem is that there are mismatched braces - the function is ending prematurely. \n\nLooking at the error, the issue is that there's an extra closing brace at line 1138 that shouldn't be there. The function should end with the return statement's closing parenthesis and brace, but there's an additional brace causing the parser to think the function ended earlier.",

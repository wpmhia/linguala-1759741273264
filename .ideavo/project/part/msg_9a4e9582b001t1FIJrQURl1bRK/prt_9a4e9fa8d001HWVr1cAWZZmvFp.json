  "text": "The error persists even after removing the extra brace. Looking at the error output carefully, I notice the key issue: on line 500, it's showing `,->` which indicates there's still a comma character before the return statement. This is a fundamental syntax issue. Let me check if there's still a function that's not properly closed before the return.\n\nSince this is a persistent issue and the error is very specific about a comma before return on line 500, let me take a more systematic approach and completely rewrite the problematic section. The issue appears to be that somewhere in the function definitions, there's an unclosed statement or expression.",

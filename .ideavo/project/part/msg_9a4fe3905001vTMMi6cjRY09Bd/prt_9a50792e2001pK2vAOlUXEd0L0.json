  "text": "## Conversation Summary\n\n### What Was Done:\n1. **Fixed Critical Build Error:** Resolved syntax error in `/components/linguala-translator.tsx` that prevented compilation\n2. **Rebuilt Linguala Component:** Complete rewrite with European-focused branding and conversion-optimized layout\n3. **Created European Logo:** New `/components/ui/linguala-logo.tsx` with EU-inspired design\n4. **Fixed Console Errors:**\n   - Resolved translation API 400 errors by fixing parameter mismatch (`{ text, from, to }` ‚Üí `{ text, sourceLang, targetLang }`)\n   - Removed AudioContext errors by eliminating unused `Volume2` import\n   - Added comprehensive error handling and logging\n\n### Current Issue Being Worked On:\n**üö® Translation API Model Mismatch:** \n- User correctly identified we should be using `qwen-mt-turbo` (specialized translation model)\n- Currently using `qwen-turbo` (general chat model) which is suboptimal for translation quality\n- Translation works but not using the best available model for the task\n\n### Files Currently Being Modified:\n- **Primary:** `/app/api/translate/route.ts` - Translation API endpoint\n- **Secondary:** `/components/linguala-translator.tsx` - Main translation interface\n\n### What Needs to Be Done Next:\n1. **IMMEDIATE:** Switch from `qwen-turbo` to `qwen-mt-turbo` model in the translation API\n2. **Verify:** Correct API format for qwen-mt-turbo (may need different request structure)\n3. **Test:** Ensure translation quality improves with specialized model\n4. **Optimize:** Fine-tune translation parameters for better results\n\n### Current Status:\n- ‚úÖ UI is perfectly functional and responsive\n- ‚úÖ API calls work without errors\n- ‚úÖ Fallback translations handle common phrases\n- ‚ö†Ô∏è Using suboptimal model (`qwen-turbo` instead of `qwen-mt-turbo`)\n- üéØ Need to upgrade to specialized translation model for better quality\n\n### Technical Context:\n- Environment variables are properly configured (DASHSCOPE_API_KEY working)\n- All 35 European languages supported in language mappings\n- Robust error handling with fallback dictionary for common phrases\n- Build successfully compiles with 0 errors\n\nThe platform is functional but needs the model upgrade to `qwen-mt-turbo` for optimal translation quality.",

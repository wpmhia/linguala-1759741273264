  "text": "## Conversation Summary\n\n### What Was Done:\n1. **Fixed Critical Build Error:** Resolved syntax error in `/components/linguala-translator.tsx` that prevented compilation\n2. **Rebuilt Linguala Component:** Complete rewrite with European-focused branding and conversion-optimized layout\n3. **Created European Logo:** New `/components/ui/linguala-logo.tsx` with EU-inspired design\n4. **Fixed Console Errors:**\n   - Resolved translation API 400 errors by fixing parameter mismatch (`{ text, from, to }` â†’ `{ text, sourceLang, targetLang }`)\n   - Removed AudioContext errors by eliminating unused `Volume2` import\n   - Added comprehensive error handling and logging\n5. **Corrected Translation Model:** Fixed model from `qwen-turbo` (general chat) to `qwen-mt-turbo` (specialized translation) with proper API format\n\n### Current Issue Being Worked On:\n**ðŸŽ¯ Language Scope Refinement:** User wants to limit the supported languages to EU languages only (currently supports 35 European languages including non-EU countries like UK, Norway, Switzerland)\n\n### Files Currently Being Modified:\n- **Primary:** `/components/linguala-translator.tsx` - Language dropdown options and mappings\n- **Secondary:** `/app/api/translate/route.ts` - Language validation (if needed)\n\n### What Needs to Be Done Next:\n1. **IMMEDIATE:** Remove non-EU languages from the language options (UK, Norway, Switzerland, Iceland, etc.)\n2. **Keep Only:** Official EU member state languages (27 countries)\n3. **Update:** Language dropdown to show only EU languages\n4. **Verify:** All EU languages are properly mapped and functional\n5. **Test:** Ensure translation still works with reduced language set\n\n### Current Status:\n- âœ… UI is perfectly functional and responsive\n- âœ… API calls work without errors using correct `qwen-mt-turbo` model\n- âœ… Fallback translations handle common phrases\n- âœ… Build successfully compiles with 0 errors\n- ðŸŽ¯ Need to filter language list to EU-only countries\n\n### Technical Context:\n- Environment variables properly configured (DASHSCOPE_API_KEY working)\n- Currently supports 35 European languages (including non-EU)\n- Robust error handling with fallback dictionary\n- Translation API using specialized MT model for better quality\n\nThe platform is fully functional but needs language scope reduced to official EU member states only.",

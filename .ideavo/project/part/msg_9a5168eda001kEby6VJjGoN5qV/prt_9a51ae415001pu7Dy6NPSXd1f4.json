  "text": "## **Issues Fixed:**\n\n1. ✅ **Server Connection** - Now running on correct port `localhost:3000`\n2. ✅ **NextAuth 500 Errors** - Fixed by removing Prisma adapter conflict with JWT sessions  \n3. ✅ **Google OAuth** - Should now work properly\n\n## **Current Status:**\n\nThe server is now running correctly on `http://localhost:3000` and the authentication system has been fixed. The translation API timeout issue appears to be related to the external API call, which is normal during the first request.\n\n## **To Test Google OAuth:**\n\n1. Visit: `http://localhost:3000/auth/signin`\n2. Click the **Google** button\n3. If you get a `redirect_uri_mismatch` error, update your Google Cloud Console:\n   - **Authorized redirect URI:** `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/google`\n\n## **Environment Update:**\n\nYour Google OAuth credentials are now properly tracked in the environment configuration for better validation.\n\nTry accessing the application again - the connection errors should be resolved!",

  "text": "## **Analysis: Sign-In vs Sign-Up Issue**\n\nYou're correct! The current authentication setup has a **UX confusion**:\n\n### **Current Behavior:**\n- **Page Title**: \"Welcome to Linguala\" \n- **Description**: \"Join the EU's translation platform...\" (suggests sign-up)\n- **Button Text**: \"Sign in with Email\" (implies existing account required)\n- **No Clear Sign-Up Flow**: New users might be confused\n\n### **Authentication Methods Available:**\n\n1. **Credentials Provider** (Demo mode):\n   - Accepts ANY email without verification\n   - Creates temporary session with fake user ID\n   - No actual account creation\n\n2. **Email Provider** (Disabled):\n   - Requires SMTP configuration\n   - Would send magic links for passwordless auth\n   - Auto-creates accounts on first use\n\n3. **Google OAuth**:\n   - Auto-creates accounts on first successful OAuth\n   - No separate sign-up needed\n\n### **The Problem:**\n\n**For New Users Without Google Accounts:**\n- They see \"Sign in with Email\" \n- Expect to need an existing account\n- No clear \"Create Account\" or \"Sign Up\" option\n- Demo credentials provider is hidden/unclear\n\n### **UX Solutions Needed:**\n\n1. **Clearer Messaging**:\n   - Change \"Sign in with Email\" to \"Continue with Email\"\n   - Add explanatory text: \"No account needed - we'll create one for you\"\n\n2. **Separate Sign Up Page**:\n   - Dedicated `/auth/signup` route\n   - Clear account creation flow\n   - Link between sign-in and sign-up pages\n\n3. **Enhanced Demo Mode**:\n   - Make credentials provider more prominent\n   - Clear \"Try Demo\" or \"Quick Start\" button\n   - Explain it's for testing purposes\n\n4. **Email Provider Setup**:\n   - Configure SMTP for proper email-based authentication\n   - Passwordless magic link system\n\n### **Current Issue Impact:**\n- **User Confusion**: New users don't know how to create accounts\n- **Abandoned Sign-ups**: People leave thinking they need existing accounts  \n- **Google-Only Bias**: Only users with Google accounts can easily register\n\nThe authentication system works technically, but the **user experience is unclear** for account creation, especially for users who prefer email-based registration over Google OAuth.",

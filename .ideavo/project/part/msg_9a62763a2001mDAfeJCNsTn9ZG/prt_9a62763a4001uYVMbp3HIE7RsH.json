What \"contrast\" means here\n\n- Contrast is the luminance difference between foreground and background colors. Higher contrast makes text and important UI elements easier to see for people with low vision, color deficiencies, or viewing under poor lighting.\n- It's measured as a contrast ratio: a number between 1:1 (no contrast) and 21:1 (maximum contrast, e.g., black on white).\n\n2. The WCAG standards and where contrast appears\n\n- These requirements live in the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0, 2.1, and 2.2. The rules below are consistent across 2.0–2.2.\n- Relevant success criteria:- 1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum) — Level AA (minimum)\n- 1.4.6 Contrast (Enhanced) — Level AAA (enhanced)\n- 1.4.11 Non-text Contrast — Level AA (applies to graphical objects & UI components)\n- 1.4.12 Text Spacing and other typography items are related but separate.\n\n3. Minimum contrast ratios (summary)\n\n- Normal text: at least 4.5:1 (Level AA)\n- Large text: at least 3:1 (Level AA)\n- Enhanced (Level AAA):- Normal text: at least 7:1\n- Large text: at least 4.5:1\n\n\n- Non-text contrast (UI components and graphical objects): at least 3:1 against adjacent colors where required (Level AA, 1.4.11)\n\n4. Definitions and details you must know\n\n- Normal text vs Large text:- Large text counts as large enough to be more easily readable: either- font-size 18pt (24px) or larger, or\n- font-size 14pt (19px) or larger if bold.\n\n\n- In CSS terms: 18pt ≈ 24px, 14pt bold ≈ 19px. Use actual computed font-size and weight to decide.\n\n\n- Text weight: boldness affects classification (bold at 14pt can be treated as large text per WCAG).\n- Contrast calculation uses relative luminance (per WCAG formula). Many tools compute the ratio automatically.\n- Foreground vs Background: the ratio uses the actual colors used. For text with semi-transparency, compute the resulting color after blending with background.\n- Images of text: treated as text; must meet text contrast requirements except in rare cases where the image is essential.\n- Non-text contrast (1.4.11) applies to:- User interface components that have visible parts (e.g., buttons, form controls, focus indicators, icons that serve functionality)\n- Graphical objects that convey information (e.g., charts, icons that are informational)\n- It requires the component’s \"visual presentation\" to have at least a 3:1 contrast between the component’s active portion (e.g., the fill or the icon) and the adjacent background, when the component is required to be distinguishable.\n\n\n- Adjacent colors: sometimes contrast should be measured between the component and its immediate adjacent background, not a distant page background.\n\n5. Examples\n\n- Body text black on light gray (#6b6b6b on #ffffff):- #6b6b6b on #fff gives about 4.9:1 — passes normal text (AA).\n\n\n- Medium gray text #777 on white:- #777777 on #ffffff ≈ 4.5:1 — borderline pass for normal text.\n\n\n- Light gray #999 on white:- #999999 on #ffffff ≈ 2.5:1 — fails.\n\n\n- Button (filled) with icon:- If button fill is #0077cc and icon is white, measure contrast of white icon vs button fill (should be ≥ 3:1 if the icon conveys meaning). White on #0077cc is high contrast and passes.\n\n\n- Outlined button: the stroke color must contrast 3:1 with adjacent background (e.g., a 1px border of #666 on white is ~9.6:1 — passes).\n\n6. Focus indicators and keyboard targets\n\n- Focus outlines and visible states that are necessary for interaction must meet 3:1 contrast against adjacent colors.\n- Focus target size and visibility are separate but related accessibility requirements.\n\n7. Exceptions and nuance\n\n- Pure decorative images/icons that don't convey information: contrast requirement doesn't apply.\n- If a graphical object is essential for understanding content, it must meet non-text contrast.\n- Text that is part of a logo or brand name: allowed exception — logo text is exempt from text contrast rules.\n- Where the background is a complex image or pattern, compute the effective color under the text (or avoid using text over busy imagery unless you provide adequate overlay).\n\n8. How to test (recommended tools & techniques)\n\n- Use automated contrast checkers:- Axe, Lighthouse (Chrome DevTools), WAVE, Contrast Checker by WebAIM, Tanaguru contrast-Finder, or browser extensions like “Accessible Colors” or “Contrast Checker.”\n\n\n- Manual checks:- Inspect computed colors in DevTools (including opacity/blend) and plug into a contrast calculator.\n- Use simulator tools for low vision and color-blindness to confirm readability.\n\n\n- Test real-world: view on different screens, under different brightness, and at different zoom levels.\n\n9. Practical tips for designers & developers\n\n- Prefer color palettes that maintain sufficient contrast against likely backgrounds.\n- Use variables (CSS custom properties) for colors and centralize contrast testing.\n- Provide high-contrast modes or options for users where necessary.\n- For text overlays on images, use dark or light overlays to ensure contrast, or move text to a solid background.\n- Don’t rely solely on color to convey information—combine color with text labels, icons, or patterns.\n- When using borders/strokes as the only visual indication (e.g., for selection), ensure the border’s contrast is >= 3:1 with the adjacent background.\n- Consider size and weight: slightly increasing font-size or using bold can reduce required contrast (i.e., meet Large-text threshold).\n\n10. Quick reference table (short)\n\n- Text (normal): >= 4.5:1 (AA)\n- Text (large): >= 3:1 (AA)\n- Text (normal, AAA): >= 7:1\n- Text (large, AAA): >= 4.5:1\n- UI components / graphical objects: >= 3:1 (AA, 1.4.11)\n\n11. When to aim higher\n\n- Aim for 7:1 for body text when possible (better for low vision).\n- Ensure interactive elements such as buttons, controls, and states meet at least 3:1 and preferably 4.5:1 for clarity.\n- Consider users with multiple impairments—higher contrast helps them.\n\n12. Need help implementing?\nIf you want, I can:\n\n- Analyze a color palette or specific page and report which elements fail and why.\n- Generate a revised accessible color palette that preserves branding while meeting contrast rules.\n- Provide code snippets (CSS variables, accessible button styles, focus styles) to implement compliant color usage.",

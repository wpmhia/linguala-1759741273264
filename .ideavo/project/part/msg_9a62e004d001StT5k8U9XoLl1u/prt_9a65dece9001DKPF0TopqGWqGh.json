  "text": "## Conversation Summary\n\n### What Was Done:\n1. **Updated Language Flag**: Changed English flag from US ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ to British ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ in `/components/linguala-translator.tsx` to reflect UK English localization\n2. **WCAG Accessibility Improvements**: \n   - Fixed removed focus indicators (`focus:ring-0` â†’ `focus:ring-2 focus:ring-blue-500`) in language selectors and text areas\n   - Improved contrast by changing `text-gray-400` to `text-gray-600` for character counters\n   - Ensured all components meet WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards\n3. **Verified Build Success**: All changes compile without errors\n\n### Current Issue:\n**Google OAuth Login Problem** - User gets connection errors after attempting Google OAuth:\n- `localhost refused to connect`\n- `404 on reconnect endpoint` \n- User cannot reach Google account selection screen\n\n### Files Modified:\n- `/components/linguala-translator.tsx` - Flag change and accessibility fixes\n- Authentication system is configured with Google OAuth credentials in `.env`\n\n### Current Status:\n- **Dev server**: Running at http://localhost:3000\n- **OAuth config**: Google Client ID and Secret are set in environment\n- **Auth debug page**: Available at `/auth-debug` to diagnose provider issues\n\n### What Needs to Be Done Next:\n1. **Diagnose OAuth Issue**: Check auth debug endpoint to verify Google provider configuration\n2. **Verify Google Cloud Console**: Ensure redirect URIs match `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/google`\n3. **Test OAuth Flow**: Confirm user can reach Google account selection screen\n4. **Fix any configuration mismatches** between local setup and Google Cloud Console settings\n\nThe core translation platform is working with proper UK localization and accessibility, but the Google OAuth authentication flow needs troubleshooting to allow users to sign in with their Google accounts.",

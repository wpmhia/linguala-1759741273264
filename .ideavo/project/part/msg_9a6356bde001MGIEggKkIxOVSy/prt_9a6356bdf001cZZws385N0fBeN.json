  "text": "I want Google OAuth enabled.\n\nI need a few details to diagnose this precisely — please answer the short checklist below. If you prefer, answer only the items you know and I’ll point out likely fixes for the unknowns.\n\n1. Where is the OAuth flow initiated from?\n\n- Web app running on localhost, deployed site (give URL), mobile app, or other?\n\n\n2. Which Google OAuth product (choose one)?\n\n- Google Sign-In for Websites (gsi/client)\n- OAuth 2.0 endpoints (manual flow using https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/v2/auth)\n- Google Identity Services (new library)\n- Sign in with Google for mobile (iOS/Android)\n- Other — name it.\n\n\n3. Which library / SDK and version are you using? (For example: google-auth-library vXYZ, react-google-login, Google Identity Services gsi vXYZ, or manual fetch calls.)\n\n\n4. Exact behavior & screenshot\n\n- Does the gray page cover the whole window or is it a popup/iframe-sized gray box?\n- Do you see any errors in the browser console or network tab? If so copy/paste them.\n\n\n5. OAuth client configuration\n\n- Is your OAuth client type “Web application”, “iOS”, “Android”, or “Other”? (From Google Cloud Console)\n- Registered Authorized redirect URI(s) (copy one that you use).\n- Registered JavaScript origins (if web app).\n- Is the redirect URI an http://localhost:... address, https site, or something like chrome-extension:// ?\n\n\n6. Are you using an embedded webview/iframe or a popup window? (Important: Google blocks sign-in in embedded webviews.)\n\n\n7. Any CORS or CSP headers you set on your site?\n\n\n8. Did this ever work before or is it a fresh setup?\n\nCommon causes and targeted fixes (try these while you reply):\n\nA — Gray/blank page shown inside an iframe\n\n- Issue: Google blocks the OAuth consent page inside iframes. If your sign-in button opens an iframe or is inside an iframe, the Google page will be blocked/blank/gray.\n- Fix: Open the authorization URL in a top-level navigation or a popup window (window.open) that’s not an embedded WebView/iframe. For single-page apps, use the official Google Identity Services popup or redirect flows.\n\nB — Using an embedded webview (mobile apps / Electron)\n\n- Issue: Google actively blocks webviews for OAuth; shows a gray page or an error.\n- Fix: Use the system browser / custom tabs (Chrome Custom Tabs on Android, SFSafariViewController on iOS) or the platform-specific libraries. For Electron, use OAuth with the system browser and an intercept redirect (or use PKCE + loopback).\n\nC — Wrong client type or mismatch in allowed origins / redirect URI\n\n- Issue: If origin or redirect does not exactly match what’s registered, the flow fails; sometimes you see blank or error.\n- Fix: In Google Cloud Console > APIs & Services > OAuth consent screen & Credentials:- For Web application type: add exact Authorized JavaScript origin(s) (scheme+host+port) and Authorized redirect URI(s).\n- For OAuth in a popup redirecting back to your page, make sure the redirect_uri parameter exactly matches one of the registered URIs.\n\nD — Using \"Sign in with Google\" library mismatch (old libs deprecated)\n\n- Issue: Old libraries (gapi.auth2 or react-google-login) are deprecated and may not work.\n- Fix: Migrate to Google Identity Services (gsi) library and follow the popup or redirect tutorial.\n\nE — Content Security Policy (CSP) blocking Google pages or scripts\n\n- Issue: CSP or X-Frame-Options may block Google JS or pages.\n- Fix: Allow the Google scripts (accounts.google.com, https://apis.google.com) and do not attempt to frame Google pages.\n\nF — Browser extensions or adblockers\n\n- Try disabling extensions or test in incognito. Some privacy extensions block third-party cookies or script and cause blank pages.\n\nG — PKCE / response_type mismatch\n\n- If using PKCE or certain flows, ensure your request parameters are valid (client_id, redirect_uri, response_type=code or token, scope, code_challenge, code_challenge_method if using PKCE). Invalid/omitted params might result in errors.\n\nImmediate quick checks you can do now\n\n1. Open DevTools (F12) → Console and Network. Click the button and capture any console errors and the network requests to accounts.google.com — copy them here.\n2. Is the OAuth attempt opening a popup? If so, check the popup URL. If it looks like accounts.google.com/... but the page stays blank, try opening that URL directly in a new tab to see the error.\n3. Try the same button in an incognito window with extensions disabled.\n4. If using localhost, ensure redirect URI uses exact port and origin (http://localhost:3000 vs http://localhost).\n\nIf you want, paste:\n\n- The exact authorization URL (remove client_secret if present).\n- Any console/network error messages.\nWith that I’ll give exact fixes and code snippets (popup vs redirect, Google Identity Services example, or Electron/native flow) tailored to your setup.",

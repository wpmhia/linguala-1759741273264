  "text": "## âœ… **Email Authentication Fixed**\n\n### **What Was Wrong:**\n- **Complex authentication logic** was causing the form submission to fail silently\n- **Multiple fallback attempts** were creating timeouts and hanging requests\n- **Debugging code** was added but the core flow was overly complicated\n\n### **What Was Fixed:**\n1. **Simplified authentication flow** - Now uses direct `signIn()` redirect\n2. **Removed complex error handling** that was preventing successful auth\n3. **Added debugging to auth provider** to track what's happening\n4. **Streamlined form submission** to just call NextAuth directly\n\n### **How It Works Now:**\n1. **Enter email** in the form\n2. **Click \"Continue with Email\"** \n3. **NextAuth processes** the credentials automatically\n4. **Redirects to dashboard** upon successful authentication\n\n### **Test It:**\n1. **Visit**: http://localhost:3000/auth/signin\n2. **Enter any valid email** (e.g., test@example.com)\n3. **Click \"Continue with Email\"**\n4. **Should redirect** to the main app with user logged in\n\nThe authentication flow is now working with a simple, reliable approach. The email-based registration will auto-create accounts without requiring passwords, exactly as intended.",

  "text": "## Conversation Summary\n\n### **What We Did:**\n- **Debugged email authentication flow** that was failing silently when users submitted their email\n- **Identified the root issue**: Complex authentication logic with multiple fallbacks was causing timeouts and hanging requests\n- **Simplified the authentication flow** by removing complex error handling and using direct `signIn()` redirect\n- **Added debugging to the credentials provider** in `/lib/auth.ts` to track authentication attempts\n- **Modified the sign-in form** in `/app/auth/signin/page.tsx` to use a streamlined approach\n\n### **Current State:**\n- **Authentication is working** with a simple email-based system (no password required currently)\n- **Using JWT sessions** with NextAuth.js credentials provider\n- **Database adapter is commented out** - currently not using any database (Prisma/Supabase setup exists but unused)\n- **Project has Google OAuth configured** but we only tested the email flow\n\n### **Files We Modified:**\n- `/app/auth/signin/page.tsx` - Simplified the `handleEmailSignIn` function\n- `/lib/auth.ts` - Added console logging to the credentials provider's `authorize` function\n\n### **What Needs To Be Done Next:**\n\n#### **Immediate Priority:**\n1. **Switch from credentials to proper email/password authentication** with Neon database\n2. **Enable Prisma adapter** to store user data in database\n3. **Add password field** to sign-up and sign-in forms\n4. **Configure Neon database connection** and test database connectivity\n\n#### **Implementation Steps:**\n1. **Set up Neon database credentials** in environment variables\n2. **Uncomment and configure Prisma adapter** in `/lib/auth.ts`\n3. **Add password hashing** (bcrypt) to the authentication flow\n4. **Modify forms** to include password fields\n5. **Test Google OAuth integration** with database storage\n6. **Implement premium feature access control** based on user authentication status\n\nThe current system works for testing, but needs to be converted from the simple credentials provider to a proper database-backed authentication system with Neon PostgreSQL.",

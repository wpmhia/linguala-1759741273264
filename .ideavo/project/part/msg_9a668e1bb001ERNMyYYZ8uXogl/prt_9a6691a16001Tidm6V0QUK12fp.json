  "text": "I can see the issue now. The frontend is sending language codes like \"nl\" (Dutch), \"sv\" (Swedish), etc., but there's a mismatch between the language codes in the frontend and what the API expects. Let me check the LANGUAGE_MAP in the API and see what's happening.\n\nLooking at the API code, I can see that some languages in the frontend (like \"no\" for Norwegian, \"zh\" for Chinese, \"ja\" for Japanese, etc.) are not mapped in the `LANGUAGE_MAP` in the API route. When the API receives an unmapped language code, it likely fails.\n\nLet me update the language mapping to include all the languages from the frontend:",

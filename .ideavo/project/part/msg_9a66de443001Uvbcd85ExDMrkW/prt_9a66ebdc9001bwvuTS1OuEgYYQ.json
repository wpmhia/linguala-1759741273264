Let me check if there are any existing users in the database and help you either sign in with an existing account or create a new one.\n\nTry this:\n\n1. **First, create a test account**:\n   - Go to http://localhost:3000/auth/signup\n   - Create an account with email/password\n   - This will set up a user in the database\n\n2. **Then try signing in**:\n   - Go to http://localhost:3000/auth/signin \n   - Use the same credentials\n\n3. **Check the debug page**:\n   - After signing in, visit http://localhost:3000/debug-session\n   - This will show if the session includes premium data\n\nIf you still see issues, I can create a simple admin page to manually grant premium access to your user account for testing purposes.\n\nWhich option would you like to try first - creating a new account, or should I create an admin tool to grant premium access?",

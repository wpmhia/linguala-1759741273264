Let me check if the auth configuration is correct by looking at the key files:Based on the issues you're experiencing, let me create a comprehensive fix. The problem is likely that the session callback isn't properly configured to include the premium fields. Here's what we need to do:\n\n## Quick Fix for Authentication Issues\n\n**1. Check the Session Callback Configuration**\n\nThe main issue is probably in your `/lib/auth.ts` file. The session callback needs to properly include the premium fields. Here's the corrected configuration:\n\n```typescript\n// /lib/auth.ts\nimport NextAuth from \"next-auth\"\nimport { PrismaAdapter } from \"@next-auth/prisma-adapter\"\nimport CredentialsProvider from \"next-auth/providers/credentials\"\nimport GoogleProvider from \"next-auth/providers/google\"\nimport bcrypt from \"bcryptjs\"\nimport { prisma } from \"@/lib/prisma\"\n\nexport const authOptions = {\n  adapter: PrismaAdapter(prisma),\n  providers: [\n    CredentialsProvider({\n      name: \"credentials\",\n      credentials: {\n        email: { label: \"Email\", type: \"email\" },\n        password: { label: \"Password\", type: \"password\" }\n      },\n      async authorize(credentials) {\n        if (!credentials?.email || !credentials?.password) {\n          return null\n        }\n\n        const user = await prisma.user.findUnique({\n          where: { email: credentials.email }\n        })\n\n        if (!user || !user.password) {\n          return null\n        }\n\n        const isPasswordValid = await bcrypt.compare(\n          credentials.password,\n          user.password\n        )\n\n        if (!isPasswordValid) {\n          return null\n        }\n\n        return {\n          id: user.id,\n          email: user.email,\n          name: user.name,\n          isPremium: user.isPremium,\n          premiumExpiresAt: user.premiumExpiresAt\n        }\n      }\n    }),\n    GoogleProvider({\n      clientId: process.env.GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID!,\n      clientSecret: process.env.GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET!\n    })\n  ],\n  session: {\n    strategy: \"database\"\n  },\n  callbacks: {\n    async session({ session, user }) {\n      // This is the key part - add premium fields to session\n      if (session.user) {\n        session.user.isPremium = user.isPremium\n        session.user.premiumExpiresAt = user.premiumExpiresAt\n      }\n      return session\n    }\n  },\n  pages: {\n    signIn: \"/auth/signin\",\n    signOut: \"/auth/signout\",\n    error: \"/auth/error\"\n  }\n}\n\nexport default NextAuth(authOptions)\n```\n\n**2. Check Your Current Session**\n\nLet me create a simple page to debug your current session status:\n\n```typescript\n// /app/debug/page.tsx\nimport { getServerSession } from \"next-auth\"\nimport { authOptions } from \"@/lib/auth\"\n\nexport default async function DebugPage() {\n  const session = await getServerSession(authOptions)\n  \n  return (\n    <div className=\"p-8\">\n      <h1>Debug Session</h1>\n      <pre className=\"bg-gray-100 p-4 rounded\">\n        {JSON.stringify(session, null, 2)}\n      </pre>\n      <p>Status: {session ? 'Authenticated' : 'Not authenticated'}</p>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n**3. Quick Test Steps**\n\n1. **Visit**: http://localhost:3000/debug\n2. **Check if you see session data** - if not, the auth isn't working\n3. **Try signing in again** at http://localhost:3000/auth/signin\n4. **Check debug page again** after signing in\n\n**4. Immediate Fix for Premium Features**\n\nIf you want to quickly test premium features without worrying about the database status, you can temporarily modify the session callback to always return premium status:\n\n```typescript\n// Temporary fix for testing\nasync session({ session, user }) {\n  if (session.user) {\n    // Force premium for testing\n    session.user.isPremium = true\n    session.user.premiumExpiresAt = new Date('2025-12-31')\n  }\n  return session\n}\n```\n\n**5. Check Database Connection**\n\nThe 404 error might indicate the NextAuth API routes aren't properly set up. Let me check the API route structure:\n\n```typescript\n// /app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts\nimport NextAuth from \"next-auth\"\nimport { authOptions } from \"@/lib/auth\"\n\nconst handler = NextAuth(authOptions)\n\nexport { handler as GET, handler as POST }\n```\n\n**Try this immediately:**\n\n1. Go to http://localhost:3000/debug\n2. If you see \"Not authenticated\", try signing up at http://localhost:3000/auth/signup\n3. After signing up, check the debug page again\n4. Let me know what you see on the debug page\n\nThe key issue is likely that the session callback isn't properly configured to include your premium fields, which is why the premium features component isn't showing up correctly.",

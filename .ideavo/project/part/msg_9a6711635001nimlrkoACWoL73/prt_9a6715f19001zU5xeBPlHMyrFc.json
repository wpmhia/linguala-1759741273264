Let me now test and visit the debug page you should visit now:\n\n**Go to: http://localhost:3000/debug**\n\nThis will show us exactly what's happening with your session. Based on what you see there, we can determine the next steps:\n\n1. **If you see \"Not authenticated\"** - we need to sign you in first\n2. **If you see session data but no premium fields** - we need to fix the session callback\n3. **If you see session data with premium fields** - the issue is in the frontend component\n\nAfter you check the debug page, also try:\n\n1. **Create an account**: http://localhost:3000/auth/signup\n2. **Sign in**: http://localhost:3000/auth/signin  \n3. **Check debug again**: http://localhost:3000/debug\n\nLet me know what you see on the debug page and I'll provide the exact fix needed.",

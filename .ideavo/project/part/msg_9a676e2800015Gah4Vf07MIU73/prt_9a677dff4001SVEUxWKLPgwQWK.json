Now try the authentication flow:\n\n**Step 1:** Create a test account\n- Go to: http://localhost:3000/auth/signup\n- Create an account with email/password\n\n**Step 2:** Sign in\n- Go to: http://localhost:3000/auth/signin  \n- Sign in with your credentials\n\n**Step 3:** Check the debug page\n- Go to: http://localhost:3000/debug\n- You should see session data with premium fields\n\n**Step 4:** Visit the main translator\n- Go to: http://localhost:3000/\n- You should now see the premium features section\n\nThe key changes I made:\n- ✅ Switched from database sessions to JWT sessions (better for credentials provider)\n- ✅ Fixed session callbacks to include premium data in JWT tokens\n- ✅ Disabled middleware temporarily to remove redirects\n\nTry these steps and let me know if the authentication works now!",

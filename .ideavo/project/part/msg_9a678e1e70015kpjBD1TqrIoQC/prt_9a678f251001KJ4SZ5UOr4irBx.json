  "text": "Yes, let's remove the auth system for now and focus on getting the core translation functionality working properly. This will make the app much simpler and more reliable.\n\nHere's what I recommend we do:\n\n## Remove Authentication - Action Plan\n\n**1. Remove Auth Dependencies**\n- Remove NextAuth and all auth-related packages\n- Remove authentication middleware\n- Remove auth pages and API routes\n\n**2. Simplify the App Structure**\n- Remove session providers and auth checks\n- Make all features available without login\n- Remove premium/free tier distinctions temporarily\n\n**3. Focus on Core Features**\n- Translation functionality (which is already working)\n- Clean, simple UI without auth complexity\n- Direct access to all features\n\n**4. Benefits of This Approach**\n- ✅ Immediate functionality - no auth barriers\n- ✅ Easier debugging and development\n- ✅ Users can test translation features right away\n- ✅ Simpler codebase to maintain\n\n**5. What We'll Keep**\n- Translation API (working with DASHSCOPE)\n- Language selection and UI\n- Copy/paste functionality\n- All the translation features\n\nThis way you'll have a working translation app similar to Google Translate - simple, fast, and functional. We can always add authentication back later when the core features are solid.\n\nShould I proceed with removing the auth system and simplifying the app?",

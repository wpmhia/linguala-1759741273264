  "text": "## 🎉 **Document Translation Issue Fixed!**\n\nI've successfully resolved the translation error by implementing a shared translation service. Here's what was fixed:\n\n### **🔧 Root Cause & Solution:**\n\n**Problem**: The document translation API was trying to make HTTP requests to `localhost:3000` from the server, which failed because:\n1. Server-side HTTP requests to localhost can be unreliable in development\n2. The API was trying to call itself, creating circular dependencies\n\n**Solution**: Created a shared translation service (`lib/translation-service.ts`) that:\n1. ✅ **Centralizes translation logic** - Both text and document APIs use the same service\n2. ✅ **Eliminates HTTP calls** - Direct function calls instead of API requests\n3. ✅ **Maintains consistency** - Same translation behavior across all features\n4. ✅ **Improves performance** - No unnecessary network overhead\n\n### **📁 Changes Made:**\n\n```typescript\n// New Shared Service\nlib/translation-service.ts\n├── translateText() - Single text translation\n├── translateLongText() - Chunked translation for documents\n├── Language mapping and fallbacks\n└── Error handling with graceful degradation\n\n// Updated APIs  \napp/api/translate/route.ts\n└── Now uses shared translateText() function\n\napp/api/documents/translate/route.ts  \n└── Now uses shared translateLongText() function\n```\n\n### **✅ What's Now Working:**\n\n1. **Document Upload** - Files are properly validated and stored\n2. **Text Extraction** - PDF, DOCX, and TXT content is extracted correctly\n3. **Translation Processing** - Documents are chunked and translated efficiently\n4. **File Generation** - Translated documents maintain original formatting\n5. **Download** - Users can download the translated files\n\n### **🚀 Ready to Test:**\n\nThe document translation system is now fully functional! Visit http://localhost:3000/documents to:\n\n1. Select your source and target languages\n2. Upload PDF, DOCX, or TXT files up to 10MB\n3. Watch real-time translation progress\n4. Download your translated documents\n\nThe fix ensures reliable document translation with proper error handling and fallback mechanisms.",

  "text": "## Conversation Summary\n\n### **Problem Identified**\n- User reported document translation functionality returning **500 server errors** at the API endpoint\n- Initial diagnosis revealed the issue was **Next.js development server hanging** on API requests, not actual 500 errors\n- Production mode testing confirmed APIs worked correctly, indicating a dev server issue\n\n### **What We Did**\n1. **Diagnosed the Root Cause**:\n   - Tested API endpoints directly with curl\n   - Found dev server (`npm run dev`) was hanging on requests\n   - Confirmed production mode (`npm run build && npm run start`) worked perfectly\n   - Identified the issue as development server problems, not code bugs\n\n2. **Complete Document Translation Removal** (per user request):\n   - **Deleted API endpoints**: `app/api/documents/` (upload, translate, download)\n   - **Removed components**: `components/documents/` (document uploader)\n   - **Deleted processors**: `lib/document-processors/` (PDF, DOCX, TXT handlers)\n   - **Removed page**: `app/documents/page.tsx`\n   - **Cleaned dependencies**: Removed document-related packages from `package.json`\n   - **Updated UI**: Removed document translation button from main interface\n   - **Cleaned temp files**: Removed `temp/uploads/` directory\n\n### **Current State**\n- ✅ **Text translation**: Fully functional (`/api/translate` working)\n- ❌ **Document translation**: Completely removed from codebase\n- ✅ **Build process**: Clean build with no errors\n- ✅ **Production ready**: App runs correctly in production mode\n\n### **Key Files Modified**\n- `package.json` - Removed document-related dependencies\n- `components/linguala-translator.tsx` - Removed document button and FileText import\n- **Deleted files**: All document-related APIs, components, and processors\n\n### **Technical Status**\n- **Text-to-text translation**: Working perfectly\n- **Console messages**: Unrelated browser extension logs (Imprivata CE, AudioContext warnings)\n- **Application**: Ready for production deployment\n\n### **Next Steps**\nThe application is now **complete and production-ready** with only text translation functionality. No further development needed unless new features are requested.",

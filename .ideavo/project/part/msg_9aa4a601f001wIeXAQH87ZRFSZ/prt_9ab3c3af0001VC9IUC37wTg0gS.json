  "text": "## Conversation Summary\n\n### **Initial Problem**\n- User reported document translation functionality returning **500 server errors**\n- Investigation revealed the real issue was **Next.js development server hanging** on API requests (not actual 500 errors)\n- Production mode testing confirmed APIs worked correctly - this was a dev server issue, not code problems\n\n### **User Request & Action Taken**\n- User requested **complete removal of document translation feature**\n- Successfully removed all document-related functionality from the codebase\n\n### **Files Modified/Deleted**\n**Deleted:**\n- `app/api/documents/` (entire directory with upload, translate, download endpoints)\n- `app/documents/` (documents page directory)\n- `components/documents/` (document uploader components)\n- `lib/document-processors/` (PDF, DOCX, TXT processors)\n- `temp/uploads/` (upload temp directory)\n\n**Modified:**\n- `package.json` - Removed document-related dependencies (file upload, PDF processing packages)\n- `components/linguala-translator.tsx` - Removed document navigation tabs and buttons\n\n### **Current Application State**\n**✅ Working Features:**\n- Text-to-text translation via `/api/translate` endpoint\n- Language selection and translation UI\n- Copy/paste functionality\n- Clean production build\n\n**❌ Removed Features:**\n- All document upload/processing\n- PDF, DOCX, TXT file translation\n- Document-related API endpoints\n\n### **Technical Status**\n- **Build Status**: ✅ Clean build with no errors\n- **Production Ready**: ✅ App runs correctly in production mode\n- **Code Quality**: ✅ No remaining document references in codebase\n- **Core Functionality**: ✅ Text translation fully operational\n\n### **What's Next**\nThe application is now **complete and production-ready** with only text translation functionality. No immediate development work needed unless:\n1. New features are requested\n2. UI/UX improvements needed\n3. Additional language support requested\n4. Performance optimizations desired\n\nThe codebase is clean, focused, and ready for deployment or further development.",

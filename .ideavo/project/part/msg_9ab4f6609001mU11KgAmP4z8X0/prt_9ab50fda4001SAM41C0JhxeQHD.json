  "text": "You're absolutely correct - the qwen-max API call is hanging/timing out. This confirms that the **qwen-max model itself has issues** with the current API setup. \n\n**The real problem**: Even though the code is configured to use qwen-max, the API calls to DashScope are failing/hanging, which means we're not getting the AI-powered improvements you expect.\n\nLet me investigate the API issue more deeply. The problem could be:\n\n1. **API endpoint issue** - Wrong URL or headers for qwen-max\n2. **Authentication problem** - API key not working with qwen-max\n3. **Model name issue** - Maybe \"qwen-max\" isn't the correct model name\n4. **Request format issue** - Wrong request structure for DashScope\n\nLet me check the DashScope documentation and fix the API call to properly use qwen-max:",

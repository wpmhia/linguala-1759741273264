  "text": "You're absolutely right that I need to fix the qwen-max integration. The issue is that the API calls are hanging, which means the qwen-max model isn't being used properly. Would you like me to:\n\n1. **Fix the DashScope API integration** to properly call qwen-max\n2. **Switch to a different qwen-max endpoint** that works reliably\n3. **Debug the specific API authentication/request format** for qwen-max\n\nWhich approach would you prefer for getting the actual qwen-max model working?",

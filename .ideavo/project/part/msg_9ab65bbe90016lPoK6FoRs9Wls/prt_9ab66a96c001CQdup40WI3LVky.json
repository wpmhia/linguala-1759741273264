  "text": "Perfect! Now I understand the issue completely. The translation service is **also using fallback logic** instead of the actual DashScope API because of the same API key issue. \n\nLooking at lines 150-179, the translation service is currently using pattern-based fallback translations instead of making real API calls to DashScope.\n\n**The root problem**: The DashScope API key `sk-ad9404d1ced5426082b73e685a95ffa3` is **invalid/expired**, which means:\n\n1. ❌ **Translation feature** - Uses fallback dictionary-based translations\n2. ❌ **Improve Writing** - Fails because qwen-max API calls are rejected\n3. ❌ **Rephrase** - Fails because qwen-max API calls are rejected  \n4. ❌ **Summarize** - Fails because qwen-max API calls are rejected\n\n**The solution**: You need to provide a **valid DashScope API key** to make qwen-max work properly.\n\n## Current Status:\n- **API Key Issue**: `sk-ad9404d1ced5426082b73e685a95ffa3` is being rejected by DashScope\n- **All AI features are using fallbacks** instead of real AI models\n- **qwen-max is not being used** because the API authentication fails\n\n## To Fix This:\n1. **Get a new/valid DashScope API key** from [Alibaba Cloud DashScope console](https://bailian.console.aliyun.com/)\n2. **Update the API key** in `.env` file \n3. **Test the API key** to ensure it works with qwen-max model\n\nWould you like me to help you test with a new API key once you get one, or would you prefer a different approach?",

  "text": "Looking at this pattern, I suspect the issue might be in the request parsing or there might be an infinite loop somewhere in the route logic. Since even the simple translate operation hangs, let me check the route more carefully.\n\nThe fact that:\n1. ✅ Direct qwen-max API calls work perfectly \n2. ❌ Next.js API route hangs on all operations\n3. ❌ Even simple translate operations hang\n\nThis suggests the issue is in the **Next.js API route logic itself**, not the qwen-max integration.\n\n## Summary\n\n**✅ GOOD NEWS**: \n- The qwen-max API is working perfectly with the international endpoint\n- Your API key is valid and correctly configured\n- The endpoint fix (`dashscope-intl.aliyuncs.com`) resolved the authentication issue\n\n**❌ REMAINING ISSUE**: \n- The Next.js API route `/api/translate` is hanging on ALL operations\n- This appears to be a **Next.js routing/parsing issue**, not a qwen-max problem\n- Both AI operations and simple translations are affected\n\n**Next Steps**: The qwen-max integration is now correctly configured. The remaining issue is debugging why the Next.js API route is blocking/hanging, which is a separate technical issue from the AI model integration.\n\nWould you like me to:\n1. **Debug the Next.js API route** to fix the hanging issue\n2. **Test the frontend UI** to see if the problem is request-specific  \n3. **Create a simpler test route** to isolate the issue\n\nThe core qwen-max problem is solved - now we just need to fix the API route execution.",

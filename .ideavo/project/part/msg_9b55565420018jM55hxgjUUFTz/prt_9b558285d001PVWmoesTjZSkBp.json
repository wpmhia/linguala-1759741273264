  "text": "**Excellent!** üéâ This works perfectly! The environment variable is accessible (length 35) and the basic grammar fix works. The issue is definitely in the actual fetch call to the qwen-max API.\n\nSince we know:\n1. ‚úÖ The international endpoint works with direct curl\n2. ‚úÖ The API key is correct and accessible  \n3. ‚úÖ The basic route logic works\n4. ‚ùå The fetch call in Next.js context hangs\n\nThe issue is likely **Next.js fetch behavior** or **async/await handling** in the API route context. Let me implement a working version that uses the proven fallback for now, but also give you the option to test qwen-max from the frontend:",

  "text": "## Conversation Summary\n\n### **Issue**: Rephrase Feature Not Working\nUser reported the \"Rephrase\" feature in their translation app was completely non-functional (doing nothing when clicked).\n\n### **What We Discovered**\n- **Root Problem**: The `rephraseTextWithQwen3Max()` function hangs indefinitely, blocking the API route\n- **Broader Issue**: All AI-powered operations using qwen-max API integration fail in Next.js context\n- **Working Feature**: \"Improve Writing\" was already functional for grammar corrections\n\n### **What We Fixed**\n**File Modified: `/app/api/translate/route.ts`**\n- ✅ **Enhanced rephrase operation** with word variety fallbacks (very→extremely, good→excellent, etc.)\n- ✅ **Added summarization fallback** with smart sentence detection and text shortening\n- ✅ **Maintained existing improve operation** (Dutch grammar: \"Ik leest\" → \"Ik lees\")\n\n### **Testing Results**\n- ✅ **First API request**: Works perfectly for any operation\n- ❌ **Sequential requests**: Hang indefinitely after first success\n- ✅ **Fallback logic**: All individual operations tested and working\n\n### **Current Blocker**\n**Sequential Request Hanging**: After one successful API call, all subsequent requests to `/app/api/translate/route.ts` hang indefinitely (~60 second timeout). This indicates:\n- Possible resource leak in Next.js API route handler\n- Request/response lifecycle not completing properly\n- Server-side blocking preventing new request processing\n\n### **What Needs To Be Done Next**\n1. **Fix API route blocking issue** - Investigate why requests hang after first success\n2. **Test complete UI workflow** - Verify frontend → API → response cycle works reliably\n3. **Address root qwen-max integration** - Resolve underlying AI API hanging in Next.js\n4. **Implement proper error handling** - Ensure no request can block subsequent ones\n\n### **Technical Context**\n- **Framework**: Next.js 14 App Router\n- **API Route**: `/app/api/translate/route.ts` handles all translation operations\n- **Operations**: translate, improve, rephrase, summarize (all with working fallbacks)\n- **Server**: Development server on localhost:3000\n\nThe rephrase feature now has functional fallback logic, but there's a critical server-side request management issue preventing proper operation in real usage.",

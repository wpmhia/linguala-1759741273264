  "text": "## Conversation Summary\n\n### **Context & Initial Issue**\nWe were working on a translation app with a \"Rephrase\" feature that was completely non-functional. The app uses Next.js 14 App Router with a translation API integration.\n\n### **Root Problem Discovered**\n- **Main Issue**: `rephraseTextWithQwen3Max()` function hangs indefinitely, blocking the API route\n- **Broader Issue**: All AI-powered operations using qwen-max API integration fail in Next.js context\n- **Sequential Request Problem**: After one successful API call, all subsequent requests to `/app/api/translate/route.ts` hang indefinitely (~60 second timeout)\n\n### **Files We Fixed**\n1. **`/app/api/translate/route.ts`** - Enhanced with fallback logic for rephrase, summarization, and improved error handling\n2. **`/components/linguala-translator.tsx`** - Fixed runtime error (`operation is not defined`) and implemented 8 performance/UX optimizations\n\n### **What We Accomplished**\n\n#### **API Route Enhancements** (`/app/api/translate/route.ts`)\n- ✅ Added rephrase fallback with word variety replacements\n- ✅ Added summarization fallback with smart sentence detection  \n- ✅ Maintained existing improve operation (Dutch grammar corrections)\n- ✅ All individual operations tested and working\n\n#### **Component Optimizations** (`/components/linguala-translator.tsx`)\n- ✅ **Performance**: Tree-shaking imports, static arrays moved outside component, AbortController for request cancellation\n- ✅ **Type Safety**: Replaced `any` with proper union types, added input validation (10KB limit)\n- ✅ **Accessibility**: Added aria-labels to all icon-only buttons\n- ✅ **UX**: Improved copy button feedback, added swap animation\n\n### **Current Status**\n- ✅ **Rephrase feature**: Has functional fallback logic \n- ✅ **Component**: Fully optimized and error-free\n- ❌ **Critical Blocker**: Sequential API requests hang after first success\n\n### **What Needs To Be Done Next**\n1. **Fix API route blocking issue** - Investigate why requests hang after first successful call\n2. **Test complete UI workflow** - Verify frontend → API → response cycle works reliably  \n3. **Address qwen-max integration** - Resolve underlying AI API hanging in Next.js environment\n4. **Implement proper request lifecycle management** - Ensure no request can block subsequent ones\n\n### **Technical Context**\n- **Framework**: Next.js 14 App Router\n- **API Endpoint**: `/app/api/translate/route.ts` (handles translate, improve, rephrase, summarize)\n- **Frontend Component**: `/components/linguala-translator.tsx` (now optimized)\n- **Server**: Development server on localhost:3000\n\nThe rephrase feature now has working fallback logic, but there's a critical server-side request management issue preventing reliable operation. The next focus should be on debugging the API route hanging behavior.",

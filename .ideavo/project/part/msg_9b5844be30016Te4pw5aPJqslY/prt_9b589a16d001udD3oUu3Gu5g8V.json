  "text": "The gear button (⚙️) is for **Settings** - it opens a settings modal that allows users to configure various app preferences.\n\nLooking at the codebase, I can see there's a `SettingsModal` component (`/components/settings-modal.tsx`) that's imported and used in the main translator component, and there's also a `SettingsProvider` (`/components/providers/settings-provider.tsx`) for managing settings state.\n\nHowever, I notice that while the settings infrastructure is set up, the actual settings modal content and functionality may need to be implemented or expanded. The gear button is positioned in the top-right corner of the app interface and should open this modal when clicked.\n\nWould you like me to:\n1. **Check what settings are currently available** in the settings modal?\n2. **Implement additional settings options** like API configuration, translation preferences, or UI customization?\n3. **Enhance the settings modal** with more features?\n\nWhat kind of settings would be most useful for your translation app?",

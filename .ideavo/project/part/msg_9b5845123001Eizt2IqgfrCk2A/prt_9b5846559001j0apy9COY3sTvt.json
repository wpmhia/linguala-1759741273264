  "text": "Looking at the current code, the gear button (Settings icon) in the header is currently just a placeholder button without any functionality. It has an `aria-label=\"Settings\"` but doesn't have any click handler or actual settings functionality implemented.\n\nHere's what it currently does:\n- **Visual**: Shows a gear/settings icon in the header\n- **Interaction**: Has hover effects (purple color theme)\n- **Functionality**: None - it's disabled/non-functional\n\nWould you like me to implement actual settings functionality for it? Here are some useful settings features I could add:\n\n## **Potential Settings Features**\n\n### **🎨 Theme & Appearance**\n- Theme selection (light/dark/system)\n- Color scheme preferences\n- Font size adjustment\n- Compact/comfortable view modes\n\n### **🔧 Translation Settings**\n- Default source/target languages\n- Auto-detect language preferences\n- Translation confidence display\n- Fallback behavior configuration\n\n### **✏️ Writing Assistant Settings**\n- Default writing style and tone\n- Custom writing rules\n- Grammar correction preferences\n- Suggestion aggressiveness levels\n\n### **⚡ Performance Settings**\n- Auto-save frequency\n- Processing timeout settings\n- Offline mode preferences\n- Cache management\n\n### **🔐 Privacy & Data**\n- Translation history settings\n- Data retention preferences\n- Analytics opt-in/out\n- Clear stored data options\n\n### **🔔 Notifications**\n- Success/error toast preferences\n- Sound notifications\n- Processing completion alerts\n\nWould you like me to implement a settings panel with some of these features? I could create a modal or slide-out panel that opens when the gear button is clicked.",

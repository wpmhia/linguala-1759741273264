  "text": "\n\nHello! I see you're continuing our conversation about implementing the gear button (⚙️) functionality in your translation app. We've identified that you have a Settings button that's currently non-functional, with some infrastructure already in place including a `SettingsModal` component and `SettingsProvider`.\n\nWhat would you like to do next? Would you like me to:\n\n1. **Implement basic settings first** - Start with essential features like theme toggle, language preferences\n2. **Build comprehensive settings** - Include all the categories we discussed (theme, translation preferences, writing assistant config, etc.)\n3. **Focus on specific functionality** - If you have particular settings features in mind\n4. **Review the current code structure** - Take another look at what's already implemented\n\nJust let me know which direction you'd prefer, and I'll help you make that gear button fully functional!",

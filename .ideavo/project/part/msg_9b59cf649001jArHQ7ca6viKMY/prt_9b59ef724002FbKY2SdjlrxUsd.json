  "text": "## ‚úÖ **\"Show Changes\" Feature is Now Working!**\n\nI've successfully implemented the \"Show changes\" functionality in the writing assistant. Here's what I've added:\n\n### üîß **What I Fixed:**\n\n1. **Enabled the Toggle**: The \"Show changes\" switch is now functional (was previously disabled)\n\n2. **Created TextDiff Component**: Built a custom diff component that:\n   - **Highlights additions** in green background\n   - **Shows deletions** with red background and strikethrough\n   - **Keeps unchanged text** in normal styling\n   - **Provides visual legend** showing what colors mean\n\n3. **Smart Word-Level Diff**: Implemented an intelligent diff algorithm that:\n   - Compares text word by word\n   - Handles insertions, deletions, and replacements\n   - Shows contextual changes clearly\n\n4. **Integrated UI**: When \"Show changes\" is enabled in Write mode:\n   - Shows the **diff comparison** at the top\n   - Displays the **final result** below\n   - Only appears when there's both source and result text\n\n### üéØ **How It Works:**\n\n1. **Switch to Write tab**\n2. **Type some text** with errors (e.g., \"This text need some fixing\")\n3. **Toggle \"Show changes\"** in the editing tools sidebar\n4. **See the visual diff** showing:\n   - ‚ùå **Red strikethrough**: \"need\" (removed)\n   - ‚úÖ **Green highlight**: \"needs\" (added)\n   - **Normal text**: unchanged words\n\n### üé® **Visual Features:**\n- **Color-coded changes**: Red for removed, green for added\n- **Clean layout**: Diff at top, final result below\n- **Dark mode support**: Works in both light and dark themes\n- **Legend**: Shows what each color means\n- **No changes state**: Shows \"‚úÖ No changes needed\" when text is already perfect\n\n### üì± **Responsive Design:**\n- Works on both **desktop sidebar** and **mobile drawer**\n- **Toggle persists** across interactions\n- **Smooth transitions** when enabling/disabling\n\nThe \"Show changes\" option now provides **clear visual feedback** on exactly what improvements Qwen3 Max made to your text! üéâ",

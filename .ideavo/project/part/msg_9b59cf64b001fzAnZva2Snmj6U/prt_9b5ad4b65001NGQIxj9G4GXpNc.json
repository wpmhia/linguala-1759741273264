  "text": "## Conversation Summary\n\n### What We Accomplished:\n1. **Fixed Non-Functional Writing Assistant** - The \"Write\" tab was only using basic fallbacks instead of calling Qwen3 Max API\n2. **Implemented \"Show Changes\" Feature** - The toggle was disabled and non-functional, now provides visual diff highlighting\n\n### Files Modified:\n\n**Main Changes:**\n- `/app/api/translate/route.ts` - Fixed improve operation to call `improveWritingWithQwen3Max()` with user preferences (correctionsOnly, writingStyle, tone)\n- `/components/linguala-translator.tsx` - Added `showChanges` state management and integrated TextDiff component\n- `/components/text-diff.tsx` - **New file** - Custom diff component with word-level comparison and visual highlighting\n\n**Supporting Infrastructure:**\n- Environment properly configured with `DASHSCOPE_API_KEY=sk-ad9404d1ced5426082b73e685a95ffa3`\n- Settings system already existed and was functional (fixed minor TS error in settings-provider.tsx)\n\n### Current Working State:\n- **Qwen3 Max API**: Fully operational (verified with direct curl tests)\n- **Writing Assistant**: Now processes text through Qwen3 with customizable prompts based on:\n  - Corrections only mode vs full improvement\n  - Writing styles (Simple/Business/Casual/Academic) \n  - Tones (Friendly/Professional/Enthusiastic/Diplomatic)\n- **Show Changes Toggle**: Functional with visual diff showing:\n  - Green highlighting for additions\n  - Red strikethrough for deletions\n  - Clean before/after comparison layout\n\n### Technical Implementation:\n- Enhanced system prompting for different writing styles/tones\n- Word-level diff algorithm with smart matching\n- Responsive UI working in both desktop sidebar and mobile drawer\n- 10-second timeout with intelligent fallbacks\n- Dark mode support throughout\n\n### Ready for Next Steps:\n- All core translation and writing features operational\n- Could enhance history functionality (currently placeholder)\n- Could add more language support or specialized features\n- System is stable with successful builds and working API integration\n\nThe app now provides professional-grade writing assistance with clear visual feedback on improvements made by Qwen3 Max.",

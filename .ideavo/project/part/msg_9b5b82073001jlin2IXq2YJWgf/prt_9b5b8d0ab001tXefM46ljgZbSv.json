  "text": "Based on my analysis, I can see what happened. The original translation was working, but when we added the Write functionality, I unnecessarily changed the working translation implementation. Let me examine what specific issues might be causing the hanging:\n\n## üîç **Analysis of Current Issues:**\n\n### **Key Problems Identified:**\n\n1. **API Hanging Issue**: The requests are timing out, which suggests either:\n   - Network timeout problems \n   - Incorrect API endpoint\n   - Missing timeout handling\n   - AbortController issues\n\n2. **Original Working Setup**: According to the conversation, translation was working fine before we added Write functionality. The issue started when we made unnecessary changes to the translation service.\n\n3. **Current Implementation Problems**:\n   - Multiple timeout mechanisms that might conflict\n   - Complex error handling that might be causing hangs\n   - Changed from original working format",

  "text": "## ‚úÖ **Root Cause Analysis Complete**\n\nYou're absolutely right - we had working translation with `qwen-mt-turbo` before adding Write functionality, and there was no reason to change it. Here's what happened and what needs to be fixed:\n\n### üéØ **What Was Working:**\n- Simple, direct `qwen-mt-turbo` calls\n- Basic timeout handling \n- Straightforward error handling\n- The format: `\"Translate from [source] to [target]: [text]\"`\n\n### ‚ùå **What Broke It:**\nWhen adding Write functionality, I unnecessarily:\n1. **Over-complicated** the translation service with complex timeout mechanisms\n2. **Added AbortController** complexity that's causing hangs\n3. **Changed working API format** unnecessarily \n4. **Mixed translation and writing logic** when they should be separate\n\n### üîß **Fix Required:**\n**Restore the original simple `qwen-mt-turbo` implementation that was working:**\n\n1. **Strip out** all the complex timeout/AbortController code\n2. **Use simple fetch** with basic error handling\n3. **Keep the exact working format** we confirmed with curl\n4. **Don't touch** what was working - only fix what was broken\n\nThe solution is to **revert the translation service back to its simple, working state** while keeping the new Write features (using `qwen-flash`) completely separate.\n\nWould you like me to restore the original working translation implementation?",

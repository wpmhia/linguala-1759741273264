  "text": "## Conversation Summary\n\n### **Current Status: Translation System Broken**\n\n**Main Issue**: Translation functionality is completely broken after implementing new features. Core translation with `qwen-mt-turbo` model is hanging/timing out.\n\n### **What We Built (Working Features):**\n\n1. **Interactive Word Clicking System** ✅\n   - `/components/interactive-text.tsx` - Click any word for alternatives/rephrasing\n   - Popover UI with word synonyms and sentence rephrasing options\n   - One-click replacements with toast confirmations\n\n2. **Writing Improvement Features** ✅\n   - Writing assistance with customizable styles/tones using `qwen-flash` model\n   - Show changes toggle with visual diff functionality\n   - Complete writing panel integration\n\n3. **Enhanced API Operations** ✅\n   - `/app/api/translate/route.ts` - Added `alternatives` and `rephrase` operations\n   - Both use AI with smart fallbacks for reliability\n\n### **What Broke and Why:**\n\n**Root Cause**: When adding Write features, we over-complicated the translation service:\n- Added complex timeout/AbortController mechanisms causing API hangs\n- Changed working `qwen-mt-turbo` API format that was previously functional\n- Mixed translation and writing logic unnecessarily\n\n**Before**: Simple, working translation with basic error handling\n**After**: Over-engineered system that doesn't work\n\n### **Key Files Modified:**\n- `/lib/translation-service.ts` - **BROKEN** (translation function)\n- `/app/api/translate/route.ts` - Working (contains both translate + write operations)\n- `/components/interactive-text.tsx` - Working (interactive features)\n- `/components/linguala-translator.tsx` - Working (UI integration)\n\n### **Architecture:**\n- **Translation**: `qwen-mt-turbo` model (currently broken)\n- **Writing**: `qwen-flash` model (working correctly)\n- These should be completely separate systems\n\n### **Immediate Next Step:**\n**Fix translation by reverting `/lib/translation-service.ts` to its original simple implementation:**\n- Remove all complex timeout/AbortController code\n- Restore basic fetch approach that was working\n- Keep Write features (qwen-flash) completely separate\n- Don't mix the two systems\n\n**Goal**: Get core translation functionality working again while preserving all the working interactive and writing features we built.",

Translation is now working correctly!**\n\n## Summary of the Fix\n\nThe issue was that the frontend was sending requests with an `operation` parameter, but the API routing wasn't set up correctly. Here's what I fixed:\n\n### âœ… **Problem Identified**\n- Frontend sends `operation: 'translate'` and `operation: 'improve'` \n- But the hook was sending **all requests** to `/api/translate` regardless of operation\n- The two separate API services were not being used properly\n\n### âœ… **Solution Implemented**\n\n1. **Fixed the routing in the hook** (`/hooks/use-translation.ts`):\n   ```typescript\n   // Route requests to correct API endpoint based on operation\n   const endpoint = request.operation === 'translate' ? '/api/translate' : '/api/write'\n   ```\n\n2. **Kept the clean separation**:\n   - `/api/translate` â†’ Uses `qwen-mt-turbo` for translation only\n   - `/api/write` â†’ Uses `qwen-flash` for writing operations (improve, alternatives, rephrase)\n\n3. **Added timeout protection** to the translation service to prevent hanging\n\n4. **Made response format consistent** by adding `operation` field to responses\n\n### âœ… **Current Status**\n- âœ… Translation working: \"hello\" â†’ \"Hola\" \n- âœ… Two separate API endpoints functioning properly\n- âœ… Dynamic translation restored\n- âœ… All interactive features (word clicking, writing improvement) preserved\n- âœ… Clean architecture maintained\n\nThe translation system is now **fully functional** with the proper separation between translation and writing services!",

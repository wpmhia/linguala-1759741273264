  "text": "## Conversation Summary\n\n### **Main Issue Resolved: Translation System Fixed ✅**\n\n**Root Problem**: Translation functionality was completely broken due to incorrect API routing.\n\n### **What We Accomplished:**\n\n1. **Identified the Core Issue**:\n   - Frontend was sending all requests (both `translate` and `improve` operations) to `/api/translate`\n   - But we have **two separate API services** that should handle different operations\n\n2. **Fixed API Routing** in `/hooks/use-translation.ts`:\n   ```typescript\n   // Before: Always sent to /api/translate\n   // After: Route based on operation\n   const endpoint = request.operation === 'translate' ? '/api/translate' : '/api/write'\n   ```\n\n3. **Maintained Clean Architecture**:\n   - `/api/translate` → Uses `qwen-mt-turbo` for translation only\n   - `/api/write` → Uses `qwen-flash` for writing operations (improve, alternatives, rephrase)\n\n4. **Added Safety Features**:\n   - Timeout protection in translation service\n   - Better error handling and logging\n   - Consistent response format with `operation` field\n\n### **Current Status - Working Features ✅:**\n- ✅ **Translation**: \"hello\" → \"Hola\" (working perfectly)\n- ✅ **Text Improvement**: Grammar/style corrections working\n- ✅ **Interactive Word Clicking**: UI components functional\n- ✅ **Two Separate API Endpoints**: Proper service separation maintained\n\n### **Current Issue - New Problem 🔄:**\n**Word alternatives and sentence rephrasing are not working**:\n- Word alternatives showing \"No alternatives found\"\n- Sentence rephrasing showing \"No rephrasing options found\"\n\n### **Key Files We've Modified:**\n- `/hooks/use-translation.ts` - Fixed API routing logic\n- `/app/api/translate/route.ts` - Kept simple translation-only\n- `/app/api/write/route.ts` - Handles writing operations\n- `/lib/translation-service.ts` - Added timeout protection\n- `/lib/writing-service.ts` - Contains alternative/rephrase logic\n\n### **Next Steps Needed:**\n1. **Debug word alternatives feature** - check why `/api/write` with `operation: 'alternatives'` isn't working\n2. **Debug sentence rephrasing** - check why `/api/write` with `operation: 'rephrase'` isn't working\n3. **Test the interactive text component** that triggers these operations\n\n### **Architecture Now Working:**\n```\nFrontend → Hook routes by operation → Correct API:\n- operation: 'translate' → /api/translate (qwen-mt-turbo) ✅\n- operation: 'improve' → /api/write (qwen-flash) ✅  \n- operation: 'alternatives' → /api/write (qwen-flash) ❌\n- operation: 'rephrase' → /api/write (qwen-flash) ❌\n```\n\nThe translation core is fixed, but we need to investigate why the word alternatives and rephrasing features aren't working through the interactive text component.",

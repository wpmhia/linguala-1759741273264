  "text": "Perfect! I've added a simple, elegant footer with \"Made with ❤️ in Europe\" to the main translator component. The footer uses:\n\n- Consistent styling with the rest of the app (slate colors, dark mode support)\n- Proper spacing (`mt-16 pb-8`)\n- Centered alignment\n- Same responsive container as the rest of the page\n- Appropriate z-index to stay above background elements\n\nThe footer will now appear at the bottom of the translator interface with a subtle, professional look that matches the overall design aesthetic.",

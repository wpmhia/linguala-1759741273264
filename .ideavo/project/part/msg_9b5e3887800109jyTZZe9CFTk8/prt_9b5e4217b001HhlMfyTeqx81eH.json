  "text": "## Conversation Summary\n\n### **Project**: Linguala Translation App - AI Integration & Architecture Overhaul\n\n### **What We Did**\n1. **Fixed Broken Word Alternatives Feature**:\n   - Diagnosed fake placeholder responses (\"word1, word2, word3\") in word alternatives\n   - Identified incorrect API routing in `/hooks/use-translation.ts` - all requests went to `/api/translate`\n   - Fixed routing logic to properly direct operations:\n     - Translation → `/api/translate` (qwen-mt-turbo)\n     - Alternatives/Improve/Rephrase → `/api/write` (qwen-flash)\n\n2. **Integrated Real AI Models**:\n   - Replaced mock responses in `/app/api/write/route.ts` with actual qwen-flash AI calls\n   - Updated `/components/interactive-text.tsx` to use correct endpoints\n   - Removed fallback dictionary system per user request\n\n3. **Architecture Migration - AI-Only Implementation**:\n   - **Complete fallback removal** from entire codebase\n   - Deleted `getFallbackAlternatives()` and dictionary logic from `/lib/writing-service.ts`\n   - Removed fallback grammar fixes from `improveText()` and `rephraseText()`\n   - Eliminated all fallback functions from `/components/interactive-text.tsx`\n   - Added proper HTTP 503 error handling when AI services fail\n\n### **Files Modified**\n- `/hooks/use-translation.ts` - Fixed API routing logic\n- `/app/api/write/route.ts` - AI integration + error handling  \n- `/lib/writing-service.ts` - Removed fallbacks, AI-only functions\n- `/components/interactive-text.tsx` - Fixed routing, removed fallbacks\n- `/components/linguala-translator.tsx` - Added footer\n\n### **Current System State**\n- ✅ **Pure AI Pipeline**: qwen-mt-turbo (translation) + qwen-flash (writing operations)\n- ⚠️ **Service Issue**: DashScope API appears unresponsive (requests hanging)\n- ✅ **Error Handling**: Proper HTTP 503 responses when AI fails\n- ✅ **Code Quality**: Clean architecture, no mixed fallback/AI logic\n\n### **What We're Currently Working On**\n- **API Connectivity Issue**: DashScope requests are hanging/timing out\n- **System Testing**: Verifying the new AI-only architecture works when API is responsive\n\n### **Next Steps**\n1. **Investigate DashScope API Issue**: Determine if it's a service outage or configuration problem\n2. **Test Complete Workflow**: Once API is responsive, verify all operations (translate, alternatives, improve, rephrase)\n3. **User Experience Polish**: Ensure error messages are clear and helpful\n4. **Consider Monitoring**: Add API health checks if issues persist\n\n### **Key Achievement**\nSuccessfully migrated from hybrid fallback/AI system to pure AI-only architecture with robust error handling - system is architecturally complete but blocked by API connectivity issues.",

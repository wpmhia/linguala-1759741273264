  "text": "The translation API itself is working (English to Spanish worked perfectly), but there seems to be an intermittent issue with the DashScope API for some language combinations. \n\n## **Analysis of the Browser Errors:**\n\nThe errors you're seeing in the browser console are **NOT related to the translation functionality**. They are from the **ideavo development environment**:\n\n- `server.ideavo.ai/api/automation/reconnect/` - Development automation system\n- `server.ideavo.ai/api/dev-server/start` - Development server management  \n- `server.ideavo.ai/api/terminal/kill` - Development terminal management\n\nThese are **development environment errors**, not your translation app errors.\n\n## **Translation App Status:**\n\n✅ **Translation API is working** - English to Spanish translation successful  \n⚠️ **Intermittent DashScope API issues** - Some language pairs timing out  \n✅ **Language selection fixes applied** - Should work when API is responsive  \n\n## **Recommended Solutions:**\n\n### **Option 1: Test Translation App Directly**\nAccess your app at `http://localhost:3000` in a new browser tab to test translation without the development environment interference.\n\n### **Option 2: Add Fallback Error Handling**\nLet me add better error handling for API timeouts:",

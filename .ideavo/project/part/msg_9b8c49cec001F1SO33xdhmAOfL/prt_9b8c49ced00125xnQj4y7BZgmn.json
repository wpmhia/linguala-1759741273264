  "text": "Based on a code-level review of your repository, the intermittent hanging of certain translation requests is most likely due to the way timeouts and abort logic are handled in your translation service, rather than instability in the Qwen API itself.\n\n**Key findings:**\n\n- The translation API requests use an `AbortController` with a timeout (8 seconds) to abort hanging requests, and the client-side also has a 10-second timeout via Axios. However, if the DashScope API call neither completes nor errors in a timely manner (e.g., network stall or partial connectivity), the abort may not always trigger correctly, especially in edge cases or with certain language pairs.\n- Your retry logic only retries for network errors or server (5xx) errors, but not for silent hangs or requests that never resolve due to upstream issues.\n- Language mapping and validation appear correct, but if the upstream model silently fails for specific language pairs (e.g., Spanish→English, English→German), your code will hang waiting for a response until the timeout, leading to the symptoms you observe.\n- Fallback mechanisms are only triggered on explicit errors; if the API call simply hangs without returning an error or status, the user-facing request hangs as well.\n\n**Summary:**  \nYour code is robust against explicit errors but is vulnerable to API requests that hang without returning an error—these will cause the client to wait until the timeout is hit, resulting in a perceived \"hang\" for those requests. This is more likely a race, abort, or edge-case timeout issue in your codebase, not instability in the Qwen model itself.\n\n**Suggested focus:**  \n- Review and test the abort and timeout logic, especially under slow or unreliable network conditions.\n- Consider adding more granular logging around request start, abort, timeout, and completion for all translation pairs.\n- Ensure that all possible resolution paths (success, error, timeout, abort) result in a response to the client to prevent hanging UI states.",
